# TJ_River_Project
This project has the overall goal of identifying, quantifying, and verifying the presence of microbes and viruses in the Tijuana River Basin.
Diversity_Analysis takes metagenomic data and a mapping file as input, performs a centered log-ratio (clr) transformation, and outputs a NMDS Plot and statistical analysis on the beta-diversity of the samples.
Fecal_Contamination takes metagenomic data and isolates crAssphage, a phage commonly associated with human fecal contamination, and HF183 bacteria, which are associated with the HF183 PCR Primer used to measure the level of fecal contamination, and uses them as inputs.
